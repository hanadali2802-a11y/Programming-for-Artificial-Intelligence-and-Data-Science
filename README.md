# Programming-for-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Data-Science
This is one of two gateway modules for the MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This module provides an intensive practical introduction to programming in Python, suitable for students with some degree of mathematical or statistical maturity. It covers a range of practical skills and underlying knowledge. These include the basic programming constructs for control, data structuring and modularisation; best practices for programming and debugging code in python; processing of larger-scale files and datasets.
## Module Synopsis
The purpose of this module is to familiarise you with the basics of practical Python programming with a particular focus on data science and AI applications.
You will mainly study: 
* translating practical questions into Python programs
* writing clean Python code
* testing and debugging your Python programs
## Module Description

## Learning Aims and Outcomes
This module is designed to give mature students an introduction to programming in a way that gives them the basic concepts and skills to develop further. It is not simply a programming module, although it does have a lot of programming content. It is designed to enable students to cope with the programming content of the further modules on the programme, not to design and build substantial programmes of their own. It therefore contains material alongside an accelerated version of the standard programming account that contains a concentrated induction to professional programming practice, both the toolchain and the approach to program structure, documentation and testing.
## By the end of this module you will have:
Knowledge of and ability to use appropriately the standard control structures in Python.
Knowledge of and ability to use appropriately the standard data structures in Python.
Knowledge of and ability to use the standard program structuring mechanisms in Python.
Understanding of the standard implementation model for programming languages.
