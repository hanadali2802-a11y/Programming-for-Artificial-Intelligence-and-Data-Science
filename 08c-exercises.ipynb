    "1. We have two lists of values, l1 and l2, which are both of the same size n. We want to create a new list l3 which will contain n values, and where the value in index i of l3 is the multiplication of l1[i] and l2[i]. We have written the following code attempting to do this. Write an improved version that reduces its complexity. "

    "**Explanation:** we have used '%%time' just to get an idea of the duration of the code, but the problem here is the complexity of the code.\n",

    "The original solution uses nested for loops:\n",
    "* The first for loops goes through each value in l1.\n",
    "* The 2nd, nested for loop goes through each value in l2 every time we get a value from l1. For l1, item 1, we go through all values in l2 to use only the one we need for the multiplication. For l1, item 2, again we go through all values in l2 to only use 1. We do this for every item in l1.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this solution, for every item in l1, we check every item in l2, which leads to a complexity of $n^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, for every item in l1, we only check its correct counterpart in l2. We can achieve this in at least two ways:\n",
    "* use zip() so go through both lists concurrently, i.e. we take item 1 from l1 and item 1 from l2 together, item 2 from l1 and item 2 from l2 together, etc.\n",
    "* we use indices (commented out above). If we loop through indices in l1, then we can directly access that same index in l2, with no need to go through the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** for an exercise like this, if you run it with $n = 5$ instead of $n = 15000$, you will see no noticeable difference, it's just a small sample and the extra complexity will not make a difference. However, the bigger the $n$, the bigger will be the difference. This is very important to consider when we work with large datasets."

    "* We were not initialising the variable total = 0.\n",
